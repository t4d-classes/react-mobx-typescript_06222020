# Exercise 15

1. Update the CalcTool app to use result as a computed field.

When you delete a history entry, the result will update automatically to reflect the history as though the entry never happened.

Try implementing the solution to make it open for receiving additional kind of computations without having to update the computed property.

2. Display a table under the history. Which lists the number of add operations, subtract operations, multiply operations and divide operations in the history.

3. Ensure it works.
